  description: `
    This tool allows the users to run evaluation tests on a circleci pipeline.
    They can be referred to as "Prompt Tests" or "Evaluation Tests".

    This tool triggers a new CircleCI pipeline and returns the URL to monitor its progress.
    The tool will generate an appropriate circleci configuration file and trigger a pipeline using this temporary configuration.
    The tool will return the project slug.

    Input options (EXACTLY ONE of these THREE options must be used):

    ${option1DescriptionBranchRequired}

    Option 2 - Direct URL (provide ONE of these):
    - projectURL: The URL of the CircleCI project in any of these formats:
      * Project URL with branch: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project?branch=feature-branch
      * Pipeline URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123
      * Workflow URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def
      * Job URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def/jobs/xyz

    Option 3 - Project Detection (ALL of these must be provided together):
    - workspaceRoot: The absolute path to the workspace root
    - gitRemoteURL: The URL of the git remote repository
    - branch: The name of the current branch

    Test File:
    - testFileContent: The content of the test file to run. This should be the content of the test file that you want to run.
      If the content is more than 1800 characters, truncate it to 1800 characters (but it should be a valid JSON file).

    Pipeline Selection:
    - If the project has multiple pipeline definitions, the tool will return a list of available pipelines
    - You must then make another call with the chosen pipeline name using the pipelineChoiceName parameter
    - The pipelineChoiceName must exactly match one of the pipeline names returned by the tool
    - If the project has only one pipeline definition, pipelineChoiceName is not needed

    Additional Requirements:
    - Never call this tool with incomplete parameters
    - If using Option 1, make sure to extract the projectSlug exactly as provided by listFollowedProjects
    - If using Option 2, the URLs MUST be provided by the user - do not attempt to construct or guess URLs
    - If using Option 3, ALL THREE parameters (workspaceRoot, gitRemoteURL, branch) must be provided
    - If none of the options can be fully satisfied, ask the user for the missing information before making the tool call

    Returns:
    - A URL to the newly triggered pipeline that can be used to monitor its progress
    `,
  inputSchema: runEvaluationTestsInputSchema,
