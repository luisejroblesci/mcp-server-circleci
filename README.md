Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a [new, standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. In this repository, we provide an MCP Server for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com).

This lets you use Cursor IDE, Windsurf, Copilot, or any MCP supported Client, to use natural language to accomplish things with CircleCI, e.g.:

- `Find the latest failed pipeline on my branch and get logs`

## Requirements

- pnpm package manager - [Learn more](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Node.js >= v18.0.0
- CircleCI API token - you can generate one through the CircleCI. [Learn more](https://circleci.com/docs/managing-api-tokens/) or [click here](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens) for quick access.

## Installation

  ```

  This is particularly useful for:
  
  - Identifying which CircleCI projects are available to you
  - Obtaining the projectSlug needed for other CircleCI tools
  - Selecting a project for subsequent operations

  Note: The projectSlug (not the project name) is required for many other CircleCI tools, and will be used for those tool calls after a project is selected.

  This is particularly useful for:

  - Quickly running pipelines without visiting the CircleCI web UI
  - Running pipelines from a specific branch

# Development

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/mcp-server-circleci.git
   cd mcp-server-circleci
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## Development with MCP Inspector

The easiest way to iterate on the MCP Server is using the MCP inspector. You can learn more about the MCP inspector at https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm watch # Keep this running in one terminal
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, launch the inspector:

   ```bash
   pnpm inspector
   ```

3. Configure the environment:
   - Add your `CIRCLECI_TOKEN` to the Environment Variables section in the inspector UI
   - The token needs read access to your CircleCI projects
   - Optionally you can set your CircleCI Base URL. Defaults to `https//circleci.com`

## Testing

- Run the test suite:

  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

- Run tests in watch mode during development:
  ```bash
  pnpm test:watch
  ```
